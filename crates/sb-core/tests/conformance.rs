//! M1-T14 — the deterministic **conformance runner**. Replays every committed
//! code→expect fixture through the full `sb-core` pipeline (parse → compile → VM) and
//! asserts each case's `stdout` or `error.errnum`. No emulator, no network, fixed RNG
//! seeds — this is Phase B (see `harness/README.md`), the hermetic gate that runs in CI.
//!
//! Three fixture sources are loaded (all share the v2 `tests:` schema — `{name, code,
//! expect: {stdout | error: {errnum}}}`):
//!
//! 1. **`harness/corpus/cases/*.yaml`** — cross-cutting curated cases.
//! 2. **`spec/tests/*.yaml`** — per-instruction `hw_verified` overlays harvested by the
//!    oracle (O-T8). These use a `tests:` top-level key (matching `harvest.py` output); the
//!    loader accepts both `cases:` and `tests:` (see [`CaseFile`]). Loaded unconditionally —
//!    no `IN_SCOPE_*` gate — so every frozen overlay case is replayed here.
//! 3. **Inline `tests:` from `spec/instructions/*.yaml`** — but only for the categories
//!    `sb-core` actually implements as pure value→`PRINT` builtins/operators in M1:
//!    **Mathematics** and **Strings** (M1-T7), the bit/logic operators `AND/OR/XOR/DIV/MOD`
//!    (M1-T6 / S-T6a), and the implemented **Control** flow (M1-T8 + parser/compiler:
//!    IF/FOR/WHILE/REPEAT/GOTO/GOSUB/ON/… — see `IN_SCOPE_CONTROL`; `CALL`/`COMMON`/`XON`/
//!    `XOFF` are later-milestone and excluded), the array/variable mutation set (`DIM`/`VAR`/
//!    `DATA`/`SORT`/`SWAP`/`INC`/… — see `IN_SCOPE_DATA_ARRAY_CONSOLE`), and the implemented
//!    **Console input/output** output builtins (`PRINT`/`COLOR`/`CLS`/`INKEY$` — see
//!    `IN_SCOPE_CONSOLE`; the `ATTR`/`CHKCHR`/`FONTDEF`/`SCROLL`/`WIDTH` builtins fold in
//!    with their own increments). Specs `sb-core` implements only *partially* contribute
//!    their deterministic cases via `IN_SCOPE_PARTIAL` (per-case exclusion): `LOCATE`'s
//!    range/arg-shape error guards fold in now while its positioned-output cases stay
//!    oracle-pending. These produce a comparable
//!    `console_text()` (or a checkable errnum). Graphics/sprite/BG/etc. instructions are
//!    intentionally out of scope here (their behavior is page/layer state, exercised by the VM
//!    unit tests + corpus cases) and are folded in as their milestones land.
//!
//! Self-checking `ASSERT__` programs are replayed by [`assert_programs_pass`] below —
//! `m1_conformance.sb3` (hand-written) and `otya_m1.sb3` (the real `otya_test.sb3` golden
//! sliced to the M1 feature set; the full file folds in once CALL/DATE$/DTREAD land).
//!
//! [`every_implemented_builtin_spec_is_in_scope`] keeps the wiring honest: it fails if any
//! registered builtin grows a spec with inline tests that isn't folded into a `IN_SCOPE_*`
//! list — so a future milestone can't implement an instruction and silently skip its
//! documented cases.
