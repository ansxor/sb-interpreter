//! Frame clock (M4-T3) — the single 60 fps frame counter behind `MAINCNT`, `VSYNC`, and
//! `WAIT`.
//!
//! SmileBASIC runs at a fixed **60 fps**; almost every duration in the language (VSYNC/WAIT
//! counts, `BREPEAT` timing, `FADE` time, animation keyframes) is a **frame count** of
//! 1/60th of a second. The whole language hangs off one free-running counter — the value at
//! pointer `[0x315ec0]` in the 3.6.0 binary — which is exactly what `MAINCNT` returns, what
//! `WAIT` counts forward from, and what `VSYNC` compares against. `disasm.py xref 0x315ec0`
//! finds *only* the WAIT handler, the VSYNC handler, and the MAINCNT getter, so there is one
//! clock, not three (see `spec/concepts/frame-and-timing-model.md`).
//!
//! This module owns that counter as [`FrameClock`]. It is pure state with no real-time
//! dependency, so it stays wasm-safe and deterministic: in the headless runner there is no
//! VBlank, and the clock only advances when something explicitly drives it —
//! [`FrameClock::tick`] (the platform's per-frame heartbeat) or [`FrameClock::wait`] /
//! [`FrameClock::vsync`] (a program blocking on frames). The real-time pacing that turns
//! [`FRAME_DURATION`] into wall-clock 60 fps lives in the native platform crate.
