# Harvest queue — behaviors needing oracle (Citra) verification

The autonomous Ralph loop **cannot** run the emulator (the Citra/Azahar oracle is offline/
manual by design — see `harness/README.md`). So when the loop implements a behavior it
can't pin down from the docs or disassembly, it records the open question here instead of
silently guessing. A maintainer later resolves these via `harness/harvest/` and freezes the
answer into a `spec/tests/<id>.yaml` overlay (`confidence: hw_verified`), then deletes the line.

Format: `- [ ] <task/id> · <question> · assumption: <what the code currently does>`

## Open

- [ ] M1-T1 (lexer) · Does SmileBASIC 3.6.0 allow full-width / kana characters in
  identifiers and labels? · assumption: ASCII-only (inherited from osb — **likely wrong**,
  SB is a Japanese product; verify and fix the lexer's `is_alpha`/identifier scan).
- [ ] M1 (general) · Exact `STR$`/PRINT double→string formatting (sig figs, exponent
  threshold, trailing zeros) · assumption: best-effort Rust formatting (see M7-T4).
- [ ] M1-T1 (lexer) · Is `1E5` lexed as `1` + ident `E5` (no exponent literal)? · assumption:
  yes (osb behavior) — confirm against 3.6.0.
- [ ] S-T1b (CLASSIFY) · Confirm CLASSIFY returns 1 for infinity and 2 for NaN, and find how
  to *produce* inf/NaN in SB 3.6.0 (no INF/NAN constant; exponent literals doubtful). Try
  arithmetic overflow (e.g. repeated X#=X#*10 from a big value) for inf and SQR(-1)/0.0/0.0
  for NaN — but those may raise errors first. · assumption: inf->1, NaN->2 (disasm: helper
  @0x20c3e0 code 3->1, 7->2). Ordinary (0) + string-error already harvested.
- [ ] S-T1a (FLOOR/ROUND/CEIL) · Do these return a Double for a Double argument (not an
  Integer)? Discriminate with a whole magnitude > i32 max, e.g. `PRINT FLOOR(3000000000.0)` —
  Double return prints the full number, Integer return would overflow (errnum 9) or wrap. ·
  assumption: returns whole-numbered Double (disasm: floor/ceil helpers @0x1ed970/0x1ed760
  are double->double; pushed via Double return path; osb agrees). Also needs STR$ formatting
  resolved (see the M1 STR$ line) to know the exact printed text.
