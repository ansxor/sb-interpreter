# Harvest queue — behaviors needing oracle (Citra) verification

The autonomous Ralph loop **cannot** run the emulator (the Citra/Azahar oracle is offline/
manual by design — see `harness/README.md`). So when the loop implements a behavior it
can't pin down from the docs or disassembly, it records the open question here instead of
silently guessing. A maintainer later resolves these via `harness/harvest/` and freezes the
answer into a `spec/tests/<id>.yaml` overlay (`confidence: hw_verified`), then deletes the line.

Format: `- [ ] <task/id> · <question> · assumption: <what the code currently does>`

## Open

- [ ] M1-T1 (lexer) · Does SmileBASIC 3.6.0 allow full-width / kana characters in
  identifiers and labels? · assumption: ASCII-only (inherited from osb — **likely wrong**,
  SB is a Japanese product; verify and fix the lexer's `is_alpha`/identifier scan).
- [ ] M1 (general) · Exact `STR$`/PRINT double→string formatting (sig figs, exponent
  threshold, trailing zeros) · assumption: best-effort Rust formatting (see M7-T4).
- [ ] M1-T1 (lexer) · Is `1E5` lexed as `1` + ident `E5` (no exponent literal)? · assumption:
  yes (osb behavior) — confirm against 3.6.0.
